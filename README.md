# FEWD Course Website

This website is built to be a tool for students taking the [Front-End Web Development](https://generalassemb.ly/education/front-end-web-development) course at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly). It is built with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Parse](https://parse.com/). Slides for the individual lessons are created with [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md).
