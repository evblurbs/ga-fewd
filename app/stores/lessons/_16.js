  description: "In this lesson we will go over the basics of forms. Forms allow you to collect data from your users. Since we are only doing the front-end implementation of the forms, we wonâ€™t be able to make that data persist beyond a single session. The majority of our class will be spent in lab, where everyone will work to add a form to the Relaxr website. If you finish the form, you can begin your homework, which is to make the Relaxr website responsive.",
