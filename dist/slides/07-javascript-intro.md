#Introduction To Programming

###Pseudo Code

Pseudocode is the process of writing a program without using the syntax of a programming language.

Note:
We will talk about algorithms later.

Pseudocode is a mixture of natural language and high-level programming constructs. For example,
If the door is closed and I want to exit the room, then open the door
This semester we will learn what these keywords and structures are and how they are used to create a program…
